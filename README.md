# Curse Pack Locator

This is an addon module using new forge systems to allow the automatic loading of any curse pack for 1.14.4.

Downloads are available here: https://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/cpw/mods/forge/cursepacklocator/

## To use it:
* Install forge 28.1.6 for 1.14.4. Grab that here: https://files.minecraftforge.net/
* Unzip the "bundle" package above, on top of your existing minecraft install folder (`.minecraft`)
* Launch the native vanilla launcher.
* Create a _new_ game _installation_ by clicking the `installations` tab and the `New` button there.
* Give the installation a name, select the `release 1.14.4-cursepacklocator` version and browse to a _new_ empty directory for your Game Directory.
* Extract the contents of the pack's zip file (downloaded from the curseforge website) into this new empty directory. It should contain a
`manifest.json` file and maybe other stuff as well.
* `Play` the new profile. The launch will pause for a moment while the curse pack downloader fetches all the mods from the curseforge website before launching into your game.
